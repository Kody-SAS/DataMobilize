# DataMobilize Hackathon
The **<#DataMobilize Hackathon : Use your code to improve road safety in Cameroon/>**, is an online competition which aims to engage young people from Cameroon in putting their coding skills and ideas in developing innovative applications that address specific road safety issues in Cameroon. 

## Introduction
The hackathon will focus on building a mobile application for road safety reporting and visualization. The candidate shall choose to work on
one of the three (3) topics below:
- **Road safety perception reporting** : Road users of different types, gender and age report how safe they feel (and why) when moving around on certain roads. 
- **Road infrastructure defect reporting** : Road users report and document infrastructure defects (potholes, broken traffic lights, missing road signs, etc.) that they see when moving around on certain roads.
- **Incident reporting** : Road users report incidents (crashes, road collapse, equipment collapse, etc..) they are witnessing and inform the corresponding authorities for assistance or intervention.

## General overview
The application should include:
- A user login option (with a guest mode),  
- Functionalities for the chosen topic (options for road safety reporting, visualization (maps, graph, charts, statistics, etc.) and exploration and other features the developers might think of). 
- The application should be able run on Android (and possibly on an iPhone).
- The developers are free to use the tech stack of their choice although cross platform solutions (React Native, Flutter, etc) are encouraged. A react native template is provided [here](https://github.com/Kody-SAS/ExpoReactNativeTemplate) if the candidates decides to use React Native as the project stack.
- The application shall be **functional** and testable.
- The candidates repository **should** contain a release tag containing the latest build of the application.

## Evaluation criteria
For evaluating hackathon projects, the following criteria will be considered : 
- Code Quality to assess how well-written and maintainable the code is, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- Testability to evaluate how easily the app can be tested for bugs and performance issues, facilitating stability. 
- Ease to Launch and Execute the App to measure the simplicity of deploying and using the app, making it user-friendly. 
- Documentation provided with the App to check the completeness and clarity of code comments, user guides, and setup instructions. 
- Extra Mile to recognize additional efforts and innovations that enhance the app beyond basic requirements. 
- Hackathon requirements adherence to check if the app meets specific criteria for login, reporting, visualization and exploration, aligning with the event’s description.
